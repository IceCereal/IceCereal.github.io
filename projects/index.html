<p>These are the projects I have worked on / I am working on. These are displayed in random order.</p>

<h3 id="memetaker-bot">MemeTaker_Bot</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/MemeTaker_Bot"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a>
One of the first bots I developed. This bot was developed to fetch a meme from 4 defined subreddits and download the meme using <code>wget</code>. This program was called by my more, ambitious SuperUserBot_V2. It also makes sure that the meme has not been downloaded before.</p>

<h3 id="superuserbot-v2">SuperUserBot_V2</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/SuperUserBot_V2"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a>
This is the second version of my first <code>Discord Bot</code>. It was a very detailed project that could have commands meant for admins, conduct polls and <b>make memes</b>. The make memes project is detailed below.</p>

<h3 id="printonimages-make-memes">PrintOnImages / Make Memes</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/PrintOnImages/blob/master/Imgproc.py"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> &lt;- This link points to the meme maker. <a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/PrintOnImages/blob/master/imInDangerMemeModify.png">A meme made by the program</a> <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/PrintOnImages/tree/general"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> In the same repository, on a different branch, I made this program to read a list of names and print names on a certificate (Image). I used this program to make certificates for a Hackathon where we had 170ish participants.</p>

<h3 id="formatparagraphs">FormatParagraphs</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/FormatParagraphs"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A SubProgram of PrintOnImages to convert a paragraph into a group of lines. I know this is quite primitive, but when I wrote it, it felt hard.</p>

<h3 id="bot-regod-new">Bot_REGOD-new</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Bot_REGOD-New"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A Bot made to collect data from <code>Reddit</code> for Data Analysis later. <a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Bot_REGOD-New/tree/master/Modules/SubredditData">The collected data is here</a></p>

<h3 id="product-analysis">Product Analysis</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/ProductAnalysis"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A program developed for a Hackathon to perform <code>sentiment analysis</code> of a word (a product, e.g. Tesla Model 3) on <code>Reddit</code> and <code>Twitter</code>. The work for Twitter is almost done. Reddit is bad with searches and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on at the moment.</p>

<h3 id="lofiautostart">LofiAutoStart</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/LofiAutoStart"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> Back when I was studying for a week or two for my final&rsquo;s, I used to listen to Lofi Radio a lot. I made a mini program to launch a webpage with a YouTube embed of a LofiRadio whenever the computer is unlocked. This would be a bit beneficial as I wouldn&rsquo;t get distracted by recommendations. This is made using <code>Batch</code> (Bash for Windows)</p>

<h3 id="harmonize">Harmonize</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Rochan-A/Harmonize"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A Blockchain based Music Sharing and Selling Platform. We built this for a Hackathon in our First Year (two friends and I) and we won first place.</p>

<h3 id="book-movie-recommender">Book-Movie-Recommender</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Book-Movie-Recommender"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A <code>Recommender-System</code> made for a HackWeek conducted in my college. A user gives the books name as an input and the Recommender outputs a Movie based on the <code>cosine similarity</code> between the summaries of the Book and the Movie. It&rsquo;s not suoer accurate as there are a lot of stop words that need to be removed and filters that need to be added. However, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll work on it because I don&rsquo;t have the time to.</p>

<h3 id="reddit-datamine">Reddit_DataMine</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Reddit_DataMine"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> The Data Mining/Analysis program made for the data collected by Bot_REGOD-new. <br>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCereal/Reddit_DataMine/master/Regression/LinRegPlots/pics.png">Linear Regression for r/pics</a><br> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCereal/Reddit_DataMine/master/Regression/PolyRegPlots/pics/Degree_3.png">Polynomial Regression for r/pics 3</a><br>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCereal/Reddit_DataMine/master/Regression/PolyRegPlots/pics/Degree_8.png">Polynomial Regression for r/pics 8</a> This one looks the best<br>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCereal/Reddit_DataMine/master/Regression/PolyRegPlots/pics/Degree_20.png">Polynomial Regression for r/pics 20</a><br></p>

<h3 id="annotation-gui">Annotation-GUI</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Annotation-GUI"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A interactive GUI made using <code>PyGame</code> to help Dr. Sunny&rsquo;s Project on NLP. Around 20 students were given this GUI as well as sources to read from. Using <code>Wordnet</code>&rsquo;s API, we get synonyms of the displayed word and the annotaters select words that have similar meanings.</p>

<h3 id="gain">Gain</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Gain"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A <code>Text Based Game Engine</code> written in <code>Java</code> for my final Java project. I&rsquo;ve put a lot of work in it, however, I think I&rsquo;ve finished only 40-45% of it. A Text Based Game Engine is harrrddd work. I did this in a week and a half. :Proud: because I got a <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>.</p>

<h3 id="wireless-sensor-network-balancing">Wireless-Sensor-Network-Balancing</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Wireless-Sensor-Network-Balancing"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A Design and Analysis of Algorithms project to balance the loads on gateways of a Wireless Sensor Netowrk using <code>evolutionary</code> and <code>genetic</code> algorithms. The code is complete, but I was unable to push it to GitHub from my computer, which is sealed in a box for the summer. It&rsquo;ll be pushed after the hols are done. I got a 10 on a 10, btw.</p>

<h3 id="iris-bot">Iris-Bot</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/Iris-Bot"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A <code>Discord Bot</code> made using <code>discord.py rewrite</code>. It is meant for a Discord Server where moderation is required. It is an open source project where the members of the Computer Science Club are the contributors.</p>

<h3 id="the-game-of-life">The Game of Life</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/The-Game-Of-Life"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life written in Python and Java for now. Plans on doing it in C++ and OpenGL exist. I also plan on adding intelligence to blobs and see how they work. But, I have to see.</p>

<h3 id="hackweek-3-game">Hackweek-3-Game</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/HackWeek-3-Game"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> I know, a <i>very</i> original name. This was a game I made with some 1<sup>st</sup> years for a Hackweek conducted by Enigma. I wrote all of it from scratch in PyGame. You feed it an image (any image) and it converts it to a map. You can play your game on this pixelated map and your objective is to find keys. The last updated version on my laptop seems to have been deleted and the repository is ~8 commits behind. I don&rsquo;t know if I will ever update it so that the repo&rsquo;s current code isn&rsquo;t buggy because &hellip; life. But, yeh -_-</p>

<h3 id="psygan">PsyGAN</h3>

<p>Early 2019, our college got a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/mahindra-ecole-centrale-launches-supercomputer-lab/articleshow/71203120.cms">supercomputer</a>. Desperate to try it out, I deployed a Generative Adversial Network to generate Psychedelic Images. I couldn&rsquo;t find a decent enough dataset, so I had to make a <a href="https://gist.github.com/IceCereal/60976aae6288b13173f17818ac702ce2">program</a> (bot) to download data from a particular data from a Subreddit. I was able to get 881 pictures from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/psychedelicartwork/top/?t=all">r/PsychedelicArt</a> (not enough -_-) and after loading a basic GAN Template from PyTorch, I was able to train a GAN that made this in 22 hours after 150 Epochs:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
<img src="/img/fake_samples_epoch_149.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</div></p>

<p style="text-align: center"> This is the final image (150<sup>th</sup> Epoch) </p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
<img src="/img/Timelapse-extended-small-size.gif">
</div>

<p style="text-align: center"> This is a GIF of the progress </p>

<p>This may not look like much, but it&rsquo;s unimaginable that a computer was able to <b>learn</b> the patterns involved and make this from scratch with information from only 881 images. Happiness! ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌</p>

<h3 id="dell-emc-hackathon-ai-enabled-cart-conversion">Dell EMC Hackathon: AI-Enabled Cart Conversion</h3>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/IceCereal/ai-enabled-cart-conversion"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> This is a submission for a 24-Hour Hackathon conducted by Dell EMC at my college on 2019-Oct-21. The problem statement was: AI-Enabled Cart Conversion. When a customer adds a product to a cart on an E-Commerce website, there is a probability that they would remove (abandon) it. Thus, a way needed to be figured out to minimize this abandoment by converting it to a success by using some sort of AI. We made a compeletely working website that picked up live data, sent it to a backend that figured out the abandonment rate and had a recommender system that recommended the right product in the event of a high abandonment. The video made by us is here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VsCsoVkk3e6KxGpAN-UA0IBrI909aaB/view?usp=sharing">Team Singularity AI-Enabled-Cart-Conversion</a></p>

<h3 id="a-couple-of-websites">A Couple of Websites</h3>

<h3 id="icsh-icecereal-shell">ICSH - IceCereal Shell</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IceCereal/OS-Lab-Sem-5/tree/master/6-16-Sept"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> A Shell completely written by me as a part of my Operating Systems Lab Course. The same repository linked also has a simulation for Page Tables and a Translation Lookaside Buffer. I wrote over 5,000 lines of C this semester. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would do again. 👌👌👌.</p>

<h2 id="internships">Internships</h2>

<h3 id="summer-2018-global-edge-soft">* Summer 2018 - Global Edge Soft</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.globaledgesoft.com/"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> I worked on 3 tasks at Global Edge Soft.
<ol>
    <li> Deep Learning: Gesture Recognition
        <ul>
            <li>
                This was my first attempt at Deep Learning. I had around a week to learn about Machine Learning. I then had a half week to learn about Deep Learning. I was able to quickly understand the need behind Machine Learning and Deep Learning and was able to get a decent understanding behind the math. I then implemented a VGG16 CNN over a dataset I had made myself and the model eventually gave 60% accuracy. There were multiple ways I could have done it better, but I think that it was a good first training.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used: Tensorflow + Keras, Python, OpenCV, VGG16
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Stereo Vision using Two Cameras
        <ul>
            <li>
                Using OpenCV and two cameras, I was able to implement Stereo Vision using two cameras. It took a few days to get things set up and to calibrate the cameras, but it worked very well!
            </li>
            <li>
                Used: OpenCV, Python, 2 Cameras
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Testing GUI for a Software Program
        <ul>
            <li>
                This was my first task. I had to make a Testing GUI for Software Program. I was assigned a week or two for it, but I finished it in ~3 to ~4 days. I learnt PyQt5 and made a 4 page GUI that triggers processes to test the software and displays a report that has a comprehensive analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used: PyQt5, Python
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol></p>

<h3 id="summer-2019-matelabs">* Summer 2019 - MateLabs</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.matelabs.ai/"><i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;color:blue;" class="fa fa-link fa-1x;"></i></a> MateLabs is a Start Up in Bengaluru that has a platform which is a Machine Learning Platform engineered for business professionals. It helps the customer design Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in a matter of minutes without touching a single line of code. At a point in MateVerse, a lot of plausible Machine Learning models are trained for a particular dataset. My task was ensure that the training took the least amount of time possible. A algorithm in MateVerse returns an approximate time that each model takes and I used that as inputs to create 2 methods to split the training of these models amongst a given number of cores. Many Machine Learning algorithms are parallelizable (i.e. they can run on multiple cores) and many are not (i.e. they can run only on one). Accounting for all this, I built 2 methods to split the models amongst a varying amount of cores: A <b>Greedy Algorithm</b> and a <b>Genetic Algorithm</b>. The Genetic Algorithm proved to be the better of the two but it took far more time than the Greedy Algorithm. The Genetic Algorithm returned the best split that took the least amount of time <b>and</b> the least amount of cores. However, because the Greedy Algorithm is &hellip; <i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;">erk, greedy</i>, it returned the best split which contained the models running on all cores.</p>

<ul>
<li>Example Greedy Output: [6 cores, model 1, model 2, model 3], [1 core, model 0, model 4, model 5], [1 core, model 6, model 7]

<ul>
<li>The 6 cores is meant for the parallelizable models. The Greedy Algorithm would have determined that this would have been the best split to run [models 0 to 7] on 8 cores</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Example Genetic Output: [1 core, model 3, model 4, model 7], [1 core, model 1, model 2, model 6], [1 core, model 0, model 5]

<ul>
<li>Genetic would have determined that this would taken the least amount of time (same as greedy) using only <i style="margin-left:0em;margin-right:0em;">3</i> cores. However, it takes more time to figure the best split.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Real Stats:

<ul>
<li>17 models</li>
<li>Greedy: Time Taken To Execute: <b>0.5 seconds</b> | Estimated Time To Train: 2,713 seconds | 8 Cores</li>
<li>Genetic: Time Taken To Execute: <b>7.8 seconds</b> | Estimated Time To Train: 2,713 seconds | 3 Cores

<ul>
<li>Generations: 50</li>
<li>Initial Population: 8</li>
<li>Chance of Mutation of Children: 40%</li>
<li>Chance of Mutation of Genes: 50%</li>
<li>Number of Best Children chosen: 4 from Crossover, 4 from mutation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
