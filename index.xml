      <description>Well, I guess this is the last post of the decade. I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Lo-Fi and working on TEDx&amp;rsquo;s website right now. A fitting way to end the decade. Lo-Fi.
I went to a market meant for electronics yesterday to buy some electronic components for the Music Reactive Desk Lamp I wanted to work on. I did buy some earlier, but for some reason, the LED Light Strip that I bought wasn&amp;rsquo;t working (it was showing random colors).</description>

      <description>Okay, I got bored. Really bored. So what do all cool kids do when they&amp;rsquo;re bored? Change their OS, obviously ðŸ™„. Yes, I changed my OS. Again. Which makes it the 4th time I&amp;rsquo;ve formatted my computer this year (excluding my Desktop format). I was running Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine) for around 2 months when I felt it to be a bit heavy and a bit buggy. I also had only one partition of 2Tb size which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really shrink into multiple partitions becuase I encrypted it with LUKS2.</description>

      <title>Pass, My New Password Manager</title>

      <description>It seems as if I do everything but the tasks on my To-Do list. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Firefox&amp;rsquo;s Lockwise (In-Built Password Manager) for a decent amount of time now and I decided that it was finally time to move on from an external password manager to my own password managing system. I started looking for Unix Password Managers and there were a few. After some consideration, I settled for Pass, a beautiful password manager that works on GPG and simplicity.</description>

      <title>I Set Up a PiHole</title>

      <description>Okay, so this wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my To-Do List but I really wanted to do this for a looong time&amp;hellip; so I did it 5 minutes ago. A couple of days ago, I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 (1Gb RAM) and decided to set up a PiHole. Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole, intended for use on a private network. is what Wikipedia says and that&amp;rsquo;s better than whatever I could have said.</description>

      <title>Way Too Soon for a Next Post</title>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sigh, yes. I know. This is probably way too soon for a next post on my blog, but hey, I&amp;rsquo;m happy that I&amp;rsquo;m keeping up with Point # 1 of my To-Do list for this winter.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anyway, the reason for this post is that I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited about To-Do list Point # 2. I&amp;rsquo;ve just spoken to the Professor about the project we&amp;rsquo;re going to be working on. We have a clear direction of what needs to be done this winter and most of next semester.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting this off for a very long time, but it&amp;rsquo;s time I do it. I have the time, I&amp;rsquo;m bored, I&amp;rsquo;m alone in the library with no one to distract me, I have a hot cup of coffee, and I have good music playing on my headphones. I want this blog to be a place where I can jot down my ideas, make a To-Do list, and track my progress in discrete intervals of time.</description>

      <description>These are the projects I have worked on / I am working on. These are displayed in random order.
MemeTaker_Bot  One of the first bots I developed. This bot was developed to fetch a meme from 4 defined subreddits and download the meme using wget. This program was called by my more, ambitious SuperUserBot_V2. It also makes sure that the meme has not been downloaded before.
SuperUserBot_V2  This is the second version of my first Discord Bot.</description>
